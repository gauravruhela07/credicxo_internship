For solving this classification, initially I used random forest algorithm. 
But it was taking too long to get trained and also the accuracy was not upto
the mark. So I used multi-layer perceptrons which was giving very good 
results. 

In pre-processing part:
I used columns from 'f1' till 'f166' and 'molecule_name' as feature vectors.
I did label encoding of 'molecule_name' column and the did one hot encoding 
on top of it. The feature named 'conformation_name' has been dropped because
it contained little information for out classfication task. After all this 
feature rearranging, I did mean normalization on them. The data is then split
into 80-20 ratio for train and test set.

Neural Network Model:
The architecture of deep neural network model has been chosen empirically.
The loss and optimizers used were categorical cross entropy and adam, 
respectively. 

Results:
The model gave accuracy of around 100 precent on test set.
Recall, F1-score and precision were also around 100 percent.
